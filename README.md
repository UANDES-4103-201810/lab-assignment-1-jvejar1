3. From the content of elements tab, we can see that the HTML code is divided by 2 keys parts, they are the head and body section, in the head we see certain information about the page and links to stylesheet, icon.

In this tab, we can open and close the different tax to see its content, and allows know that elements that are inside another

In the body section we can see that there is the code that generate the elements in the view, table, table header, table rows, etc. Each element is inside a tax that identifies it. For example,
the main table is inside de <table>...some elements of table.. </table>, and inside the table tax, there is the <tr>..table..row</tr>.

There are two tables, the heading table (in orange color) and the body table (inside the orange table)

The scrip tax defines the code that are executed at certain moment or at certain action, the scripts can be in native language (Javascript) inside the tax, or can be linked by an URL to a .js file

The span tax generates a void rectangle that allows put any element inside

We can see the some icons for the table and gifs

5. XHR is a interface tha allows client perform HTTP and HTTPS requests to the web server in background, its body can be of type HTML, XML and JSON, the interface is a class that a client can generate how much instances as needs it (Wikipedia). Thus, the client can load the different elements in separated ways (image, video,icon, etc) without have to reload the entire page.

The elements were loaded in different moments (differents xhr requests), dont matter when, they were loaded in background in order to be used by the web browser to generate the entire web page
